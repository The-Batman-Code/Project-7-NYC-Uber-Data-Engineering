# Introduction - 
This Data Analytics/Data Engineering project involves normalizing/denormalizing existing data for various purposes. I have already created a data model and visualized it. The transformation steps needed for establishing the data model have been completed using Pandas and Mage. Analytical queries using SQL on BigQuery have been written. Employing SQL joins, I have denormalized the data essential for our dashboard. The final step involves creating our analytics dashboard.
